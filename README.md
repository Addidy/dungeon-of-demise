Ludum Dare 36: GameJam entry

In this game you play as Kermit the frog dressed as Indiana Jones trying to escape from a temple after taking the golden idol.
This game has boulder traps, dart traps and the slowly closing door trap that you can power slide under.

Since my last Ludum Dare I really wanted to learn animation to put into my next game (this one) and I managed to accomplish it.
